# Frontend

- This directory is the `frontend` of the blog app.
- The **frontend** is being created with `ReactJs` and `TailwindCSS`.
- We are using [`react-hot-toast`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hot-toast) to manage the notifications for a good **UI and UX**.
- We are using [`axios`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to handle the requests to the backend.
- We are using [`redux`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) to manage the state of the app.
